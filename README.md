## Scoring

- Scoring is done in band ranging from band 1 to 9
  
- Band 1: Non-user of English
- Band 3: Very limited English user
- Band 7: Good user of English
- Band 9: Expert user of English

The average of all scores is taken to calculate your overall Band
for Example

- Reading: 7.5   
- Listning: 7   
- Writing: 5.5    
- Speking 6.5    

Total = $\frac{26.5}{4}$ = $6.626$ $\approx 7$ band ovreall

### Rounding Scores

- Averaged scores ending in .25 round up to the nearest **half point**   
6.25 $\rightarrow$ 6.5   

- Averaged scores ending in .75 round up to the **next band**
6.75 $\rightarrow$ 8

- Not in the case of decimals smaller than 2, in this case its rounded **DOWN**
6.125 $\rightarrow$ 6

### Whats a good score

- Well it largely depends on your institution
- A score of 5.5 to 7.5 is considered as a good score
